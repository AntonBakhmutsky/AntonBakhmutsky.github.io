    li
      | Create a "Course" class which has three properties: "title", "length"
      | and "price" (all set up in the constructor). Instantiate the class twice
      | (two dummy courses of your choice). Output the objects to the console.
    li
      | Add two methods to the "Course" class: A method which calculates the
      | length/price value ("how much length do you get for the amount paid")
      | and one method that outputs a nice course summary (including title,
      | length and price). Call these methods thereafter (and output the result
      | to the console).
    li
      | Create two new, more specialized, classes: "PracticalCourse" and
      | "TheoreticalCourse". Both should be based on the "Course" class but
      | "PracticalCourse" should also have a "numOfExercises" property,
      | "TheoreticalCourse" should have a "publish()" method (which just prints
      | something to the console). Instantiate both and use the new AND old
      | properties and methods.
    li
      | Use getters and setters to ensure that the "price" property can only be
      | set to a positive value and is returned with a "$" in front of it.
    li
      | Use private fields to harden the getter/ setter approach from before.
